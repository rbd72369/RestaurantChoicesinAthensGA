    Mexican cuisine is a blend of indigenous (Indian) and Spanish influences that is characterized by its spicy chilies and fresh ingredients such as tomatoes, avocados, and corn. Though we have a more Americanized version here in Athens, the food is just as delicious. Mexican Restaurants in Athens serve tacos, enchiladas, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, guacamole, and all the complimentary salsa your heart could desire.

    Corn is the basis of the Mexican diet, as it has been for thousands of years. It can be found in almost every meal, usually in the form of the tortilla (flatbread). Popular fruits and vegetables are tomatoes, tomatillos (green tomatoes), squash, sweet potato, avocado, mango, pineapple, papaya, and nopales (from the prickly pear cactus). Though beef is consumed, chicken and pork are more common. The variety of chilies includes the widely known jalape√±o, as well as the poblano , serrano , and chipotle . Chilies give Mexican cooking a distinctive flavor, which is often enhanced with herbs, such as cilantro and thyme, and spices, including cumin, cinnamon, and cloves. Cheese and eggs round out the diet. Seafood is most common in coastal dishes.
