    BBQ is characterized by its tender, slowly cooked meats and regionally special sauces. To just name a few: North Carolina uses a vinegar sauce, South Carolina uses a mustard sauce, and Kansas City uses a tangy, sweet sauce. In Athens, we have BBQ joints that uses all kinds of sauces from all regions of the country giving each bite a unique and tender flavor.
